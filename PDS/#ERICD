Sam,

When doing research for a CRC algorithm to implement for the
NAACCR standard record layout I could only find one well
documented example and this is the one I chose.  I'm sure there
may be different CRC checksum implementations used with ethernet
and other applications.  For more information on the Rocksoft(tm)
Model CRC Algorithm (the one I chose) see the document titled "A
Painless Guide to CRC Error Detection Algorithms" by Ross
Williams (ross@guest.adelaide.edu.au.).  This document is likely
to be in the FTP archive:

ftp://ftp.adelaide.edu.au/pub/rocksoft .

  (Note:  We have it here - member CRCPAPER.)

Hope this helps.

Eric
