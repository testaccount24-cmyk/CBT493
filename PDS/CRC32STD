                 CRC CHECKSUM Implementation Guide

This document may be used as an implementation guide for the NAACCR
standard CRC CHECKSUM. This field will help ensure integrity of
NAACCR records when they are transmitted electronically. The CRC
CHECKSUM field should be implemented beginning with NAACCR Record
Layout Version 7.

Information included on this page should be adequate to allow
software vendors to quickly implement the CRC Checksum field. A
"C" API has been developed and contributed for public use by Eric
Durbin. The API includes the following routines:

*CalcCRC32() - Calculates and returns the CRC32 for a record.
*AssignCRC32() - Assigns (fills in) the CRC CHECKSUM field for a record.
*CompareCRC32() - Compares the CRC CHECKSUM field against the calculated
CRC CHECKSUM for a record.

Please refer to the C Implementation file for further details.

Test routines are also included to test the API functions.
